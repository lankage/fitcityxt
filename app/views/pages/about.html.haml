  %h1 About CRISpy

%p{style: 'width: 80%;'}
  CRISpy is a web application that generates and filters guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.  This tool focuses on generating guide RNA sequences for the S. cerevisiae genome S288C.

%h3 Change Log
%br
%p
  %strong v1.3.1
  %ul
    %li Fixed bug where custom target submission returned no results with lowercase sequences
    %li Progress spinner no longer showing on clicking back
    %li Reverse complement of sgRNA sequence appears in export
    %li Target name is appended to sgRNA name is export
    %li Clear button added to custom target submission text input
    %li Search bar added to custom target submissions list
    %li Coordinate zoom within genome browser fixed for custom targets   
%p
  %strong v1.3
  %ul
    %li Custom target submissions now center the genome track view on the supplied custom sequence.  
    %li Custom target submissions now can search for offsite hits within the selected genome <br /> even if the custom sequence is not present in the selected genome.
    %li PAM sequence separated from spacer sequence in results table
    %li Coverge count column now sortable
    %li Can click the sgRNA sequence name to view that results page
    %li Can export selected result rows to Excel
    %li Helix in logo should now be 'Right-Handed'
    %li Y22-3 Strain renamed GLBRCY22-3
    %li Strain coverage was being mis-reported for sgRNAs targeting the reverse strand.  Counts should now be correct.
    %li Fixed issue with 'Y22-3' name being mis-reported as 'Y22'
    %li Y22-3 specific genes now included
    %li Can click sgRNA sequences in the browser to jump to their listing in the results table
%br
%p
  %strong v1.2
  %ul
    %li Gene dropdown change to auto-complete with required 2 characters of the gene symbol be entered.  Greatly improves the responsivesness of the form element.
    %li Re-Order tracks in viewer to center gene track between positive and negative strand sgRNA sequence sites
    %li Allow submission of custom sequences where not also searching for off target hits in a reference genome.  User sets genome = 'None'
    %li Form elements on main page no longer spill out of panel on smaller screens
    %li Add release notes to about page
    %li Add Help page
    %li Add Column for within gene coordinates to run pages

    %li Add editable comments field on a specific guide RNAs page.  User who created it can edit.
    %li Make Columns sortable on run results pages
    %li Color code table cells where offsite target count is > 0
%br 
%p
  %strong v1.1
  %ul
    %li Gene dropdown change to auto-complete
    %li Track coloring inside of IGV to show strandedness
    %li Input their own sequence and look for off-site targets
